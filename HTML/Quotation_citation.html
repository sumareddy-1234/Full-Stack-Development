    <!--quotes if included, should be identifiable. Also, the browser needs to render this appropriately. This is why the quotation and citation element is introduced in HTML.

The quotation element helps to display the quotation texts with an alignment such that it looks unique and different from the remaining textual content.

By default, the quotation element is rendered visually with indentation by the browsers.

The quotation element also helps to include the citation, i.e., the URL from where the quote has been picked. This helps to retain the reference courtesy to the original site.
Quotation element is defined using <blockquote>...</blockquote> tag.

The source of the quote is mentioned in the cite attribute of the blockquote element.
The content enclosed inside <blockquote>...</blockquote> will appear in Chrome browser with default indentation
Defining quote using the <blockquote> element.
